# date-typer
A short and sweet Python script that types the date in ISO-compliant Year-Month-Day format (YYYY-MM-DD)

I type the date a lot (I'm a student and I'm constantly writing things for classes), and I got tired of typing the date all the time. So, I made a Python script to do it for me. I use a Logitech G710, and I was able to assign one of the macro keys to run this script (I had to make it a .pyw file instead of a .py file in order for that to work). That way, the date is one keypress, and it's always correct.
